Frontal Faces Capture
===

##### Code cleaning is still in progress.

Introduction
---
##### This repo always reminds me those beautiful memories in Wuhan University.
This repo is the last project I finished in Wuhan University. The project is built both for Signal Processing Lab and Vision and Intelligent Transportation System developing center. They both focus on intelligent tranportation systems(ITS).

Get started
---
To see demo.py.

This is a small demo that requires a video as an input and it captures the frontal faces automatically, after which cascaded a face recognation algorithm to tell you who he/she is. Sounds interesting? See demo.py.

Intallation
---
OpenCV and python 2.7+.     

The main functions are built in C++. Python is used as a wrapper, making demo a more convenient showing.

Have to appreciate Wuhan University and Signal Processing lab where I starts my Computer Vision tour.
